# Weather App

This is a weather app using data from the Accuweather API. I used the NetNinja Modern JavaScript course on Udemy as a guide, but my code is slighly different as I tried working ahead where possible before watching Shaun's solution.

To use the code:

1. Register for a free API key with Accuweather

- Go to https://developer.accuweather.com/
- Fill out your information to register for a free account
- Go to "My Apps"
- Click "Add New App" & fill out the information for your app
- Click on the App name
- Copy and paste the API key and use this string as the value for the 'key' variable in forecast.js

## Overview

Users can submit a location in the input field and retrieve current weather conditions for that location.

## My process

Followed the given design specs. I would have probably included labels otherwise (for potential accessibility reasons).

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Still to learn:

- would it be possible to offer choices as the user types (for example, 'Perth, ON' and 'Perth, WA') could be displayed if the user typed only 'Perth' allowing them to select the correct one.
- clean up code and look for ways to clean any duplication
